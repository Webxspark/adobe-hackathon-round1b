# Challenge 1b: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence - Approach Explanation

## Methodology Overview

Our solution implements a persona-driven document intelligence system that extracts and prioritizes relevant content from PDF collections based on specific user personas and their job requirements. The approach combines rule-based text extraction with relevance scoring algorithms optimized for CPU-only execution.

## Core Components

### 1. PDF Text Extraction
We utilize PyMuPDF (fitz) for robust PDF text extraction, implementing a section-based approach that:
- Extracts text content page by page with structural awareness
- Identifies potential section headers using heuristic patterns (title case, keywords, length constraints)
- Creates meaningful content blocks while preserving page information
- Handles various PDF formats including scanned documents and structured text

### 2. Persona-Driven Relevance Analysis
The system employs a keyword-based relevance scoring mechanism that:
- Maps personas to domain-specific keyword sets (travel planning, HR processes, food services)
- Analyzes job descriptions to extract task-specific keywords
- Scores content sections based on keyword frequency and context relevance
- Prioritizes sections using weighted scoring (job keywords = 3x, persona keywords = 2x)

### 3. Content Prioritization
Sections are ranked using a multi-factor approach:
- Primary scoring based on persona and job keyword matches
- Secondary scoring for content substantiality and structure
- Importance ranking from 1 (highest) to N (lowest relevance)
- Extraction of top 10 most relevant sections per collection

### 4. Output Structure
The system generates structured JSON output containing:
- **Metadata**: Input documents, persona, job description, processing timestamp
- **Extracted Sections**: Top-ranked sections with document source, titles, and page numbers
- **Subsection Analysis**: Detailed content previews for the top 5 sections

## Technical Constraints Compliance

- **CPU-Only Execution**: No GPU dependencies, using efficient text processing algorithms
- **Model Size**: ≤ 1GB constraint met through lightweight PyMuPDF library usage
- **Processing Time**: Optimized for ≤ 60 seconds per collection through efficient text extraction and limited content analysis depth
- **No Internet Access**: Self-contained solution with no external API dependencies

## Scalability and Generalization

The solution is designed to handle diverse document types and personas through:
- Configurable keyword mappings for different domains
- Flexible section detection algorithms adaptable to various document structures
- Generic relevance scoring framework extensible to new persona types
- Modular architecture supporting additional document formats and analysis methods

This approach ensures robust performance across the wide variety of documents, personas, and job requirements specified in the challenge while maintaining computational efficiency and accuracy.
